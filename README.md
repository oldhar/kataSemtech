# coding-interview

## The exercise
You've been given CSV files (e.g. _population_2019_500.csv_). The files contain the population of French cities.  
We would like you to write a program that takes a CSV file as input and print to stdout:
* a line for each department with:
  * the department name
  * the total population for the department
  * the city with the largest population
* a line with the department name with the smallest population

## More instructions
* write your code in Java or Scala
* tend to minimize the use of external dependencies (not forbidden)
* provide instructions to run your program
* provide tests and instructions to run your tests

## Even more instructions about industrialization
We rely a lot in automation for build/release and deploy, 

* can you propose a test/pull-request workflow and a build workflow using GHA or any solution you have access/knowledge ?
* can you propose a solution to host a simple service on which we would feed this csv and get the output result ?

## How to submit your solution
Send us an archive of the project.

## Good luck!
Please donâ€™t spend more than 2 hours on this exercise, and let us know if you have any questions.
